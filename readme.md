Foodie is a web application helpping people to solve the problem of making hard decision about "what do you want to dinner/lunch"?
It is like Uber Food!
User could just generally describe what kind of food he/she want, and the vender will try to satisfy user's needs.
Vender in Foodie is not neccesary to be a resturant, it could be anyone who can cook with quality! 
Your food might be from a housewife in your neighborhood!

We build this app for HackISU 2016 spring.
